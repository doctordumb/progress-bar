# progress-bar

https://ironcladinfosec.com/ansi-escape-codes/


Colored progress bar using ANSI escape codes in python

The trick here is to move the cursor to the far left (using the D code), clearing the screen then re-printing the whole bar adding the progress to it.
The default bar length is set to 100, which can be changed using -b switch

Right now, only the colors red, yellow and green are updated. You can add as many as you want in the dictionary and update accordingly.

usage: load_progress.py [-h] [-b] [-e] [-c] [-s]

Custom loading bar.
